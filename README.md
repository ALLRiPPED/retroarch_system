### MelonDS 

#### BIOSes

/!\ **dsi_nand.bin** is too big to be uploaded on this repo. You will have to add it manually.

The dumps are European (EUR) for those who want the US version, it can be downloaded at this address : https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_files#Nintendo_DS_.2F_DSi

#### SD Card

DSi mode is optional

You can get the SD card image (**dsi_sd_card.bin**) by yourself or from the melonDS site.

If you are dealing with DSiware, it is better to do it with melonDS alone instead of RetroArch.
